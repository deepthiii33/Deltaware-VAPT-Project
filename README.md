# Deltaware VAPT Internship Project

This repository contains my internship project on **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**, conducted at **Deltaware Solution Private Limited**. The testing was performed on intentionally vulnerable web applications ‚Äî **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)** and **OWASP Juice Shop** ‚Äî to explore and demonstrate real-world web security flaws.

---

## üìå Project Objectives
- Identify and exploit web application vulnerabilities aligned with the **OWASP Top 10**.
- Perform manual and automated security testing.
- Document real attack scenarios and recommend security remediations.
- Build hands-on experience with penetration testing tools and methodologies.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Burp Suite (Community Edition)** ‚Äì Web proxy for intercepting and manipulating requests
- **sqlmap** ‚Äì Automated SQL injection testing tool
- **Kali Linux** ‚Äì Testing environment
- **Browser Developer Tools** ‚Äì Manual inspection and token analysis

## üìÇ Project Documentation
The full VAPT report is available in this repository:

üìÑ [`VAPT Project Report`](https://github.com/deepthiii33/Deltaware-VAPT-Project/blob/main/Deltware%20VAPT%20Project.pdf)

The report includes:
- Testing methodology
- Payloads used (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
- Screenshots (where applicable)
- Impact assessments
- Security recommendations

---

## üîí Vulnerabilities Tested
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM-Based)
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- Broken Access Control (IDOR, Privilege Escalation)
- Security Misconfiguration
